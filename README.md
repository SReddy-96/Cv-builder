# CV Builder

## Summary
This Project is to create a React app that lets the users input their data and using `useState` be bale to keep track of the import and produce a CV in HTML form.

## Notes

Wanting to keep track of the state inside the App.jsx so the whole app can access the data via props

separating into components:
- general information (name, location, email, phone number, summary)
- Education (school name, title of study, date of study)
- Job Experience (title, location, description, time start, time end)


edit buttons and submit button for the whole CV. (make sure to add back the data to the input fields)

do a timeout loading screen to compile the data into the cv.
